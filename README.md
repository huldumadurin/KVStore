## KVStore
A simple, hashtable-based Dictionary.

## Instructions
I didn't finish setting the file up as a library but you can run the file /src/hashmap-dict.py and see it working.

### add(key, value)
Adds a value to the dictionary
### get(key)
Gets a value from the dictionary


The hash table set up in the file is extremely small, to play with collisions, but you can change the size to whatever you want.
Data saving and loading is not implemented.
